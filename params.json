This program by no means *compensates* for ill-models, it's sole task is to perform reasonable non-linear simulation of Quadcopter dynamics with a control law specified by the programmer and produce an Isometric 3D wireframe animation.\r\n\r\nApart from this, the repo holds attitude estimation software that runs on an arduino. We plan to make a complete Arduino based flight controller.\r\n* Attitude estimation using 6DOF fusion using MPU6050 *(accelerometer, gyroscope)*\r\n* Wireless communication between PC and Quadcopter using XBEE radios.\r\n* Trajectory control.\r\n* Flight Control Ground Station to send commands and view liv status of Quadcopter.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\nYou need an Arduino Board and an MPU6050. See the wiki on [how to hook up an MPU6050 to an arduino](http://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/index.php/6_DOF_Sensor-MPU6050_%28SKU:SEN0142%29).\r\n+ Flash `arduino/saber.cpp` onto Arduino Uno or Mega2560 using the Arduino IDE.\r\n+ Launch `ground_station/kalman_binary.py` on the PC. You should see an animated real-time GUI visualising the attitude of MPU6050 chip.\r\n  - Kill the process using `Ctrl` `C` to exit.\r\n  - The `.py` script may have to launched twice incae you do not see the plot.\r\n\r\n![Snapshot of kalman_binary.py in action](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9897445/11621002/d0c21f32-9cdd-11e5-911d-e7066bb343ef.png \"Snapshot of kalman_binary.py in action\")\r\n\r\nIf you need wireless communications, hook the `RX` and `TX` of the XBee radio into the Arduino's Serial `TX` `Rx` pins. Make sure the XBees are in `AT-transparent` (not in `ZB`) mode *(Just flash or make sure the firmware on both radios is 802.15.4)*. This time, instead of `kalman_binary.py` launch `kalman_wbinary.py`.\r\n\r\n# Built upon\r\nsimQuad uses\r\n* **[matplotlib](http://www.matplotlib.org)**\r\nto perform the 3D plotting, specifically uses the Artist.FuncAnimation() to create a Quadcopter-animation object.\r\n* **DynamicsEngine**\r\nThis is just a set of differential equations that approximately model the physics of the quadcopter. We just increment the timestep and generate the position and orientation vectors for the quadcopter.
